Largely relies on the implementation in hf-doc-builder, while adding some customizations for Quarto.\nThis processor expects the following directives:\n\nautodoc, (str): Should contain the exact import location (or relative) of an object or function to document, such as nbquarto.processors.AutoDocProcessor.\nmethods, (List[str], optional): A list of methods to expose for the specified class. If nothing is passed, all public methods will be documented. If special methods should be documented including all special methods, such as __call__, the key all can be passed along with the special methods to document.\n\nExamples:\nTo expose all public methods:\n#| autodoc: nbquarto.processors.AutoDocProcessor\nTo specify specific functions to document along with the init:\n#| autodoc nbquarto.processors.AutoDocProcessor\n#| methods process\nTo expose all public methods and include special or hidden methods:\n#| autodoc nbquarto.processors.AutoDocProcessor\n#| methods all, __call__\n\n\n\nCodeNoteProcessor\n<source>\n\n(notebook: AttributeDictionary)\n\n\nA processor which checks and reorganizes cells for documentation with the proper explanations\nSpecifically will look at source code cells that have markdown cells following them. Each markdown cell should contain #| explain followed by a selection of the source code the markdown cell is explaining. The processor will then create a panel tabset with the original code and the new explanation.\nFor example:\nIn a code cell:\ndef addition(a,b):\n    return a+b\nIn a subsequent markdown cell:\n#| explain `addition(a,b)`\nThis function adds two numbers together"
